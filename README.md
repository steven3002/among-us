<h1>üõ∏ Among Us Game - Built with Cartesi</h1>

This is a simple version of the **Among Us** game, developed using the **Cartesi Machine**, **Cartesi Rollup APIs**, and **JavaScript** as the programming language. The frontend is powered by **Cartesi CLI**.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Create a Room:** Start by creating a room and wait for at least 2 players to join.
2. **Host Responsibilities:** The host should start the game and will be the admin responsible for managing vote deadlines and the game state.
3. **Role Assignment:** Roles are assigned randomly:
   - The number of imposters is determined by the number of players:
     - 1 to 9 players: Maximum of 1 imposter.
     - 10 to 16 players: Maximum of 3 imposters.
     - 17+ players: Maximum of 5 imposters.
4. **Starting Room:** All players begin in the **Hall** room.
5. **Ship Layout:** The game takes place in a ship consisting of 8 rooms.

```javascript
{
    1: 'Engine Room',
    2: 'Hall',
    3: 'Cafeteria',
    4: 'Electrical',
    5: 'Medbay',
    6: 'Navigation',
    7: 'Reactor',
    8: 'Security',
  }
```

### üó≥Ô∏è Ejecting Players

-  Players can be ejected by voting them out of the game during a meeting.

### üèÜ Winning the Game

- **Crewmates Wins** if:

## üïπÔ∏è Game Functions
### 
Note: The code is based on a frontend CLI, so the inputs are in the format { "method": <methodName>, "request<T>": <T> }. Since the system processes input from the terminal as a string, I have included a double JSON.parse to make it easier for you to copy and paste from your JSON-to-String converter.

Also, Note: The game uses (report) for error handling and notifications of failed computations, while (notice) is used for successful computations. Therefore, when you send an input, watch out for both.
