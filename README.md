     - 1 to 9 players: Maximum of 1 imposter.
     - 10 to 16 players: Maximum of 3 imposters.
     - 17+ players: Maximum of 5 imposters.
4. **Starting Room:** All players begin in the **Hall** room.
5. **Ship Layout:** The game takes place in a ship consisting of 8 rooms.

### üèÜ Winning the Game
